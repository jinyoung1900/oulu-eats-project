# OuluEats-project

This was my MSc project at the University of Oulu, combining a map-based prototype with full project documentation, including scheduling, resourcing, and team planning (/docs).

---

## üìå About the Project

The goal was to assist international and local students with a user friendly app that offers:
- Map-based navigation
- Restaurant ratings and reviews
- Augmented reality previews (prototype level)
- Gamification like ‚ÄúI visited here‚Äù check-ins
- Social media integration

> Designed and tested using **Figma**

Beyond the visual prototype, this project included formal documentation such as:

- A detailed Software Plan outlining the app's scope, features, and UI logic
- A full Project Plan with team roles, timeline, resource allocation, and risk analysis
- A Final Report reflecting weekly progress and project execution

These documents demonstrate my ability to manage early-stage planning for digital products in a structured team environment.
