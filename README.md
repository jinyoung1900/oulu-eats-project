# OuluEats-project

This is a project developed at the University of Oulu as part of my Masters Degree. The main objective was to build a map based mobile prototype that helps new students in Oulu discover restaurants and eateries around the city.

## 📌 About the Project

The goal was to assist international and local students with a user friendly app that offers:
- Map-based navigation
- Restaurant ratings and reviews
- Augmented reality previews (prototype level)
- Gamification like “I visited here” check-ins
- Social media integration

> Designed and tested using **Figma**
